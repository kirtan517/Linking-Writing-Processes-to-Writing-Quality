Challengs


- [ ] First Try Machine learning model 
  - [ ] Dataset creation
    - [ ] Incremental (id * 100000 + event_id)
    - [X] Drop the Id column
    - [ ] Remove Move from in Categorical Columns
    - [X] Change the text_change column
    - [ ] Change the Events - idea to aggregate all the punchuations 
    - [ ] Change the Socring system - divide the score by the number of events
    - [ ] Drop the Event column - To make the columns independent
    - [ ] Make the score some incremental average or something (Should do something like this!)
  - [ ] Exploratory Data analysis 
  - [ ] Machine learning Model
- [ ] Try Deep Learning type model to learn  sequential data
